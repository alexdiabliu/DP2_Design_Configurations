The main menu function, as the name suggests, acts as a ‘home base’ of sorts. It allows for the user to choose which of the subprograms below they would like to execute, and this main menu function will continue to run until the user manually exits it.
    
Subprogram 1 is a simple input/output program that specifies certain properties regarding the material.
    
Subprogram 2 uses a given set of data on a type of material (polymers) to calculate the number of cycles until the material will fail.
    
Subprogram 3 serves to determine the number of years until the compressive strength of the bone surpasses the reduced bone stress; in other words, the amount of years until failure.
